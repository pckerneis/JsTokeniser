# JsTokeniser
A simple JsTokeniser for JUCE

It is meant to be used along with JUCE's [CodeEditorComponent](https://docs.juce.com/master/classCodeEditorComponent.html) to provide it with syntax highlighting for Javascript code.
Not all modern Javascript reserved words were added as this code was originally meant to be used with JUCE's emebedded interpreter (see [JavascriptEngine](https://docs.juce.com/master/classJavascriptEngine.html)).
